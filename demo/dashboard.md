### **Commerce Dashboard**

Welcome to the Commerce Payments Protocol demo. This interactive dashboard showcases how blockchains can power the complex, real-world needs of modern commerce‚Äîfar beyond simple wallet-to-wallet transfers.

Discover how businesses can reserve funds, settle payments after fulfillment, manage refunds, and resolve disputes with transparency and control.

### **Why This Matters: Solving Real Commerce Challenges**

Modern commerce isn't just about getting paid. Businesses need sophisticated tools to:

*   **Reserve Funds** and settle them later to align with shipping and fulfillment timelines.
*   **Safely Return Money** through voids, reclaims, and full or partial refunds.
*   **Resolve Disputes** with a clear, documented process that links evidence to specific transactions.

The dashboard brings these essential commerce patterns onchain, combining the flexibility businesses need with the security and transparency of the blockchain.

### **Dashboard Capabilities: Your Control Center**

This demo provides a hands-on experience with a powerful, operator-facing dashboard. Here‚Äôs what you can do:

*   **üìä At-a-Glance KPIs:** Instantly view live payment volume, total refundable value, active disputes, and available operator liquidity.
*   **üîç Real-Time Payment Tracking:** Follow every payment through its entire lifecycle with a clear, auditable timeline. Every step links directly to the blockchain explorer for independent verification.
*   **‚Ü©Ô∏è Effortless Refunds:** See which payments are eligible for a refund and process full or partial returns with a single click.
*   **‚öñÔ∏è Streamlined Dispute Resolution:** A central hub to log disputes, attach evidence, update status, and approve refunds, creating a clear audit trail.

### **Understanding the Payment Lifecycle**

Our protocol mirrors real-world commerce with clear, defined payment states. As you use the demo, you'll see payments move through these statuses:

*   **Authorized:** Funds are successfully reserved for a purchase, like a hold on a credit card.
*   **Captured:** The reserved funds are settled and transferred to the merchant after fulfillment.
*   **Charged:** A single-step transaction where authorization and capture happen instantly.
*   **Refunded:** Funds are returned to the original payer.
*   **Voided / Reclaimed:** The authorization is canceled, and the reserved funds are returned to the payer before capture.

### **See It in Action: A 3-Step Guide**

Experience the end-to-end flow in just a few minutes:

1.  **Simulate a Purchase:** Use the **"Payment Ops"** tab to create a payment. Choose between an instant settlement (`Charge`) or a two-step flow (`Authorize` then `Capture`).
2.  **Track the Payment in Real-Time:** Navigate to the **"Payments"** tab to see your transaction appear on the status board. Click to view its detailed timeline and onchain record.
3.  **Handle Post-Purchase Events:** Move to the **"Refunds"** or **"Disputes"** tabs to see how easily you can manage returns and resolve issues for the payment you just created.

### **The Technology Powering Our Demo**

This demo is built on the audited, open-source components of the Base Commerce Protocol.

*   **AuthCaptureEscrow:** The core smart contract that manages the payment state and executes all operations (`authorize`, `capture`, `refund`, etc.).
*   **TokenStore:** A per-operator vault that safely segments escrowed funds.
*   **Token Collectors:** Pluggable modules for sourcing funds for payments and refunds.
*   **PaymentInfo & Time Windows:** The immutable terms of each payment, with built-in expiry deadlines (`authorizationExpiry`, `refundExpiry`) that provide safety and prevent funds from being locked indefinitely.
*   **Fee Framework:** A flexible system for defining fee constraints.
